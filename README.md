# ONLINE-TIFFIN-SERVICE-SYSTEM

Online Tiffin Service System is a web based application which allows the administrator to handle
all the activities online quickly and safely. Using Interactive GUI anyone can quickly learn to use
the complete system. This system will give power and flexibility to administrator to manage the
entire system from a single online portal. The platform being created will provides a much more
descriptive display of all items that a person can order and a much larger choice of cuisines while
also taking in regard the common food options which people might be allergic to. The food will
be cooked by different families in city who will be authenticated and help the food have a much
more homecooked feel.

This project uses the iterative model for software development.
We are using this model because the requirements needed for our project are defined clearly and
covers all the main area. Since we already know what all information would needed, it would help
design the diagrams in a much more accurate way. Similarly, after designing each webpage, each
code should be consequently generated and tested as it will be more efficient, rather than first
designing everything and then implementing, cause if a problem or change arises at a later stage it
would be more of a hassle to make changes in every phase and every instance of that error.
Therefore, by processing/dividing the project into stages/parts and executing each stage separately
is more well organized and reduces the chances of error. Also, if the need to make any changes
occurs, it will be much easier to locate the place where the change is needed as this model allows
us to access earlier phases.
