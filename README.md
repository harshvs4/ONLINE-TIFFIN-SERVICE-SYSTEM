# ONLINE-TIFFIN-SERVICE-SYSTEM

## DESCRIPTION

Online Tiffin Service System is a web based application which allows the administrator to handle
all the activities online quickly and safely. Using Interactive GUI anyone can quickly learn to use
the complete system. This system will give power and flexibility to administrator to manage the
entire system from a single online portal. 

This project uses the iterative model for software development.
We are using this model because the requirements needed for our project are defined clearly and
covers all the main area. Since we already know what all information would needed, it would help
design the diagrams in a much more accurate way. Similarly, after designing each webpage, each
code should be consequently generated and tested as it will be more efficient, rather than first
designing everything and then implementing, cause if a problem or change arises at a later stage it
would be more of a hassle to make changes in every phase and every instance of that error.
Therefore, by processing/dividing the project into stages/parts and executing each stage separately
is more well organized and reduces the chances of error. Also, if the need to make any changes
occurs, it will be much easier to locate the place where the change is needed as this model allows
us to access earlier phases.



 ## Hardware Requirements

## CONCLUSION
This Application provides a computerized and automated version of Online Tiffin Service
System which will benefit the users who search Tiffin service online. It makes entire process
online and can generate reports. It has a facility of user’s login where users can book tiffin service
and also view their invoice details. The Application was designed in such a way that future
changes can be done easily. The following conclusions can be deduced from the development
of the project.

• Automation of the entire system improves the productivity.

• It provides a friendly graphical user interface which proves to be better when compared to
the existing system.

• It gives appropriate access to the authorized users depending on their permissions.

• It effectively overcomes the delay in communications.

• Updating information becomes so easier.

• System security, data security and reliability are the striking features.

• The System has adequate scope for modification in future if it is necessary.
